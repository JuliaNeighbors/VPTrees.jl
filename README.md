Implementation of Vantage Point Trees in Julia. 
A Vantage Point Tree is a metric tree which can be used for nearest neighbor or radius searches in any metric space.
See [Data structures and algorithms for nearest neighbor search in general metric spaces](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/nndatastructures.pdf).
